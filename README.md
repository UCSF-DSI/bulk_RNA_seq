# UCSF DSI RNA seq

Welcome to the UCSF Data Science Initiative's bulk RNA-sequencing workshop. This course is primarily built on the following software:

- [Limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html)
- [EdgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)

These are both hosted via [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) - setup instrucations can be found on our course webpage and in the first notebook of the series.

### Official UCSF DSI Course Materials

Team-reviewed, tested, and ready-to-use materials will always be hosted on our official UCSF Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE) [RNA-seq webpage](https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/view.php?id=6137).

_This GitHub repository is for development purposes and therefore may stray from the materials used in class._ CLE will remain as it was at the time of our most recently offered workshop and will only be updated if major changes are introduced to the course.

Branch "master" should function as intended if cloned, but for verified materials please download all documents and data from CLE unless otherwise instructed.

# Workshop Setup Instructions:

#### *Please do not wait until the day of the workshop to do these installations*! We cannot spend class time working through installation issues.

Installation instructions for this course are on our CLE RNA-seq webpage. If you have trouble with installations up until the day before the workshop, please email both Angelo and Karla:  

- Angelo Pelonero: [angelo.pelonero@ucsf.edu](mailto:angelo.pelonero@ucsf.edu)

- Karla Lindquist: [karla.lindquist@ucsf.edu](mailto:karla.lindquist@ucsf.edu)  

Instructors will also be in the classroom half an hour before a workshop begins. However, this time will be for minor troubleshooting issues only. If you have major issues (or if you wait until this time to begin your installations) we cannot guarantee that you will be set up in time to follow along with the workshop.
